# History of cryptography

Cryptography has been used for thousands of years to hide secret messages.

Julius Caesar was known to use a form of encryption to convey secret messages to his army generals posted in the war front. This substitution cipher, known as Caesar cipher, is perhaps the most mentioned historic cipher in academic literature.

Another ancient method for hiding messages, is Scytale.

The Scytale is a cipher that is based on a transposition method. The diameter of the Scytale can be regarded as the key of the cipher. In Ancient Greece, the belt of the messenger was composed of a stretch of leather which had characters written on the backside. It seemed like a meaningless sequence of characters but when the stretch of leather is winded around a piece of wood with the correct diameter, an encoded message can be read.
