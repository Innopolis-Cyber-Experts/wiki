# ðŸš© CTF

CTF (Capture The Flag) are competitions in which teams/individuals collect "flags" by solving cybersecurity challenges.

There are several common types of CTFs:

* Jeopardy - to get the flag you need to solve a task. Tasks are divided into categories and by difficulty
* Attack-Defence - you need to exploit opponent's systems, while securing yours. Format can vary, but often you need to automate the exploitation process and drain flags from opponents servers
* Penetration testing - to get the flag you need to get into systems. Flags can be leaved in various places: files, databases, code. You can learn more about penetration testing at [Offensive security](../offensive-security/) section
